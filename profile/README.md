# Non-Equilibrium QCD

We are a collaboration of scientists working on diverse aspects of theoretical High Energy Physics, namely on the side of Quantum Chromodyanamics.
The topics our collaboarion works with are

* Effective Kinetic Theory 
* Classical Statistical Field Theory
* Hydrodynamical Simulations [Travis Dore](https://github.com/tdore738)
* Saturation Physics
* Critical Phenomena
