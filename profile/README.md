# Non-Equilibrium QCD

We are a collaboration of scientists working on diverse aspects of theoretical High Energy Physics, namely on the side of Quantum Chromodyanamics.
The topics our collaboarion works with are

* Effective Kinetic Theory 
* Classical Statistical Field Theory ( ) 
* Hydrodynamical Simulations ([Travis Dore](https://github.com/tdore738) )
* Saturation Physics ([Oscar Garcia-Montero](https://github.com/thegarzo))
* Critical Phenomena ([Frederic Klette](https://github.com/fklette))
* Functional Renormalization Group ([Yunxin Ye](https://github.com/yeyunxin))
